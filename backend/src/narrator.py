All Claude API interactions for ForeSight.

Design principle — Claude does narration only, never maths:
The statistical engine (forecast.py, validation.py, anomaly.py) produces
all numbers. Claude receives a small, structured JSON bundle of those
numbers and converts them into plain English. This means:
  1. Claude cannot hallucinate a wrong forecast value.
  2. Prompts are tiny — fast and cheap on the free tier.
  3. No customer data ever reaches the Claude API (privacy-safe).

Model choice — claude-haiku-4-5:
Haiku is the fastest and most cost-efficient Claude model. For our use
case (structured input → short paragraph output) it performs identically
to Sonnet at a fraction of the latency and cost.

All AI narration for ForeSight using Google Gemini API (free tier).

Why Gemini:
- Generous free tier (15 RPM, 1M tokens/day)
- Fast responses suitable for real-time dashboard use
- Simple SDK, near-identical usage pattern to Anthropic

Design principle unchanged — Gemini does narration only, never maths.
All numbers come from the statistical engine. Gemini receives structured
JSON and converts it to plain English. No raw CSV data is ever sent.
